been thought necessary to give an English-Latin
Vocabulary‚ as most of the words used in each
Exercise occur in the corresponding section of the
text, except in the case of some very common
words and of a few others which are supplied within
brackets in the several ExerciseS.

The Vocabulary is divided into sections corre·
sponding with those of the text, and each Latin
word is explained in the Vocabulary on its first
occurrence. When the same word recurs in a later
part of the book its place in the Vocabulary may
be found by means of the Index.

The N otes supplement the Vocabulary in the· few
cases where an explanation of the text is required
in a form not suitable for a Vocabulary.

In preparing the Text and Notes I am chiefly
indebted to Kraner and Hofmann’s edition of the
three books of the CommentarieS. I have also de-
rived some assistance from Malcolm 'Montgomrey's
excellent edition of the first book.
